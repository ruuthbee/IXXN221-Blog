          <h3>Persona Workshop</h3>
          <p>Personas are great tools to use when designing as it allows you to refer back to the intended user and make sure your design has them considered in the center. 

            It is definitely a struggle to create a persona that actually feels like a real person and not make it too stereotypical while still believable.

        </div>
        <div class="g-100 padded">
          <p>I personally struggled to come up with a persona before creating a design. This is something I want to be aware of because the design should be molded around the person and not the other way around. People shouldn’t be accommodating the design, the design should be accommodating them. I think that not considering the different pain points and motivations of people could lead to groups of people who have more unique struggles being left out pf consideration when designs are being created. It would be easy to say that they are just not the intended recipient of the design, but if there is not alternative that caters to their needs, what are they left with?

            Considering how the internet has almost always had goals of developing communities and is ever becoming more and more essential to becoming involved in community and creating a relationships (virtual and physical), people who are unable to participate due to accessibility issues not being considered in the design, missing out on the same level of connection.

          <p>I found it really interesting looking into the history of the internet became what we know it for. Particularly how it started with tight constraints graphically and that it was first created to communicate scientific information. Today its main goal is to still communication of information just how it is able to do this and what type of information being communicated is much more diverse. </p>
          <p>I think that it’s pretty interesting that some of the earliest websites created were all about creating something personal and representing the individual, seen in the GeoCities project where people created virtual website cities.</p>

          <p>“75% of users say the experience of a brand/website is just as important as the product.”</p>
          <p>reflecting on this and the history of web, I think that it’s so important not to view the abilities of digital products as static but by continuing to consider a variety of users experiences, the boundaries and possibilities will continue to be pushed. It feels quite overwhelming at certain times because the development seems so fast and intangible at times, like you’re caught in a strong current down a river, you don’t really have the choice to put your feet down and stay still.</p>

        <p>We see a great example of memphis illustrations used by Hinge to the right.</p>
        <p>Trends are constantly changing and as the scene gets more and more saturated by a certain trend, like memphis illustrations, we'll see a shift in what's considered popular, more exciting, and innovative.</p>
        <p>As a designer I think it is important to be aware of trends and how to use them but to not stop yourself from going beyond them. As trends only last so long and fresh ideas will replace them.</p>

            <li>
              <p> Thinking up a persona is a lot harder than I thought it would be. I guess it goes to show how diverse the needs and wants off users can be. Creating a persona for the different intended users is important so that the app can be designed in a way that considers all it's users.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>I found the venn diagram definitely helped me to step into the shoes of my user. It forces to think from a different perspective. It was really interesting seeing which overlapped betwen the designer and the user. It also relates to a marketing perspective as it finds where the value is for each party involved.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The user flow will definitely help inform the direction of my next assignment. It helps to know the different steps of the process that need to be designed. Although I don't know if this is the finalised user flow it definitely gives designing a starting point.</p>

          <p>This assignment really pushed my web design skills. I'm still just getting the hang off thinking of compositions that format well as websites too, not just graphically. An example of this is getting the header and navigation bar the right size in relation to the rest of the components in the screen.</p>
          <p>This assignment is one of the more complex figma projects I've done and it's the first where I tried making local styles and wireframes. My organisation is definitely not perfect yet but I feel that this assignment has help me grow my ability in that area.</p>

            <p>I decided to use CMS for the second half of assignment 2 as I'm very new to coding and with such a tight time frame to get it done, I don't want to compromise on my design.</p>
            <p>Since starting my project on Webflow I've actually found that I'm using alot of my knowledge learnt through the coding lectures. I think that using a CMS like Webflow is a good stepping stone to coding. The interface has similiarities to figma and adobe illustrator, both of which I'm accustomed to, but uses similiar language and tools used in HTML. For example, sections, flex boxes, and grids.</p>

              It made making the layout much easier to make responsive and less complicated than what I was doing before.

              Using Webflow has definitely helped build my understanding of coding for web design, even though its CMS.

              The Neighbourhood Garden Project website is coming along pretty well, but I'm definitely learning as I go. There are a few things that I'm struggling with and if I had more time I'd make it more interactive.

      <h3>Assignment Reflection</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Making things responsive is hard. There are a lot of different moving parts to think about. I think I have a new found appreciation for websites that are fully responsive in ways that work well!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>I feel that I understand how grids and flex boxes work much better. My website design required quite a few problem solving sessions but in the end I was getting much more profficient at creating grid layouts that were responsive. The most challenged part to make responsive would be the about section and the map with the region buttons over top. This is because the background images are organically shaped and would move around underneath the text/buttons when the browser size was changed. This was particularly problematic for the about section because it meant that the text was not always reable. I managed to find a solution by changing the measurement for the text to a responsive one, rather than using px, and creating a margin and padding to make sure the text stayed inside the shape.</p>

                <em>Coding Lectures:</em>
                <p>These were really helpful in giving a good basic foundation of understanding. Coding is like a learning a language, so the more that I have been able to practice consistently the more I've improved. I'm still very much at a beginner understanding level, but considering when I started this course I had no idea how to even start coding anything, I'd say that I've learnt heaps. Using resources, such as W3schools, alongside the coding lectures, has helped me build something like this blog (which is pretty simple) and I feel confident enough to be able to find the information I need to continue to develop and learn skills on my own.</p>
              </li>

                <em>Overall thoughts about the course:</em>
                <p>This course has been pretty good! I think that I definitely have a better knowledge about Web Design. It felt pretty challenging as it was fully online. I was push out of my confidence zone, as I had no choice but to try my best to engage over zoom (something I usually feel to shy to do). So, I'm considering this good professional development as a lot of jobs are partially or full remote these days which means that learning how to contribute, and collaborate online is important to learn.</p>
                <p>I really enjoyed learning a bit about the history of web design. It helped contextualise what we were learning. I'm also glad that we had lectures convering the different aspects of web design, such as composition, colour, typography, etc. This really helped in completing my assignments.</p>
                <p>I've created customer journey maps user flows before but this was the first time where I created a fully fleshed out persona and used venn diagrams. I deffinitely feel as though I have more tools to use as an interaction designer.</p>
                <p>I'm excited to continue to develop my skills and knowledge of webdesign. </p>
